## The World Greatest And Smartest Artificial Intelligence
Well first and of course this is just a temporary name until we find a better one for this project, well this will be the beginning of this new journey of building the greatest ai of all that kind that you see only in movies and shows an ai that can talk and interact with people and all, and of course it is the greatest pain to build or even structure that's why I'm writing this markdown file which will be the foundation and the point where it will all start.
## Some Features

This is just some highlights, more will be discussed and detailed.
- Community built
- Fully decentralised
- Built from the very ground
- Built with future in mind
- Super modular
- Self-Preservation Future
- Scalable.
- ...

### Community Built
This is very impossible to be done by 1 man or 1 group of people or even 1 giant company, this need a whole community to work on it each doing a part each building something each adding sorting clearing patching debugging, that way we can see her alive in our lifespan because it won't feel good otherwise

(you may have noticed that I call the ai she and not it, because simply we are not building an object here).
### Fully Decentralised
A very important point is that this ai should be decentralised so she can survive because the way it is going to be built and we will discuss that in more details later on isn't like one software running all the stuff in a server and we have a mirror to back it up no it will be running on a blockchain like system which will guarantee its uptime and the security of the data in it which is super important also it will give a better faster computing power since an ai require a huge amount of data processing.

### Bottom to top
The current internet and technology has gone in very phases and some parts are still from the way they were built late in the 90 even though technology advanced by a lot but some stuff were never touched or reconsidered because they work good and still work so why bother ? well this ai is meant to lead the future and stay it's meant to be able to maintain its code by itself update it fix it and many more that's why everything in it should be built from scratch that way every part is built for it every peace in its software is a part of a puzzle and in the future maybe even hardware

### Super modular
The decentralisation of the ai won't be just in term of nodes where it will be running but also in the software it will be running, or a better fitting name, each program of the ai is like enclosed in a sphere and uploaded to the nodes using a custom ai node manager those spheres are cloned to guarantee their 100% uptime and their lifetime availability also when they are being updated the way it will work is by preserving the old version and making the new one above it with higher priority on the same sphere that way the ai history is always maintained 

### Scalable
Well when building something that is meant to lead the future then it should be able to keep up with it, the spheres I was talking about are meant to be in a network and all connected to each other and then they keep being copied to nodes depending on the demand, those nodes are simply computers in the network and the owners of them get rewarded via a custom token that token which will be needed in order to access special features and you can get the token when u give data to the ai as well, simply when u give data you get token when you take functions you give token, and we're not talking about simple stuff like talking to the ai or asking her for the weather, we are talking about some advanced stuff that give a specific load on the network to keep everything in check
